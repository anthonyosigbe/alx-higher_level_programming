"""Addresses the N-queens puzzle, which involves,
determining all valid solutions,
for placing N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

Example:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N

The value of N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A list of lists containing the solutions.

Solutions are presented in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]],
where 'r' and 'c' denote the row and column, respectively, for the placement,
of a queen on the chessboard.
